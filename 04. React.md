## ðŸ”¹ Basic

**1. What is React, and what are its main features?**  
- **React** is a JavaScript library for building **user interfaces**, mainly for single-page applications.  
- **Main features**:  
  - Component-based architecture  
  - Virtual DOM for fast rendering  
  - Declarative syntax  
  - JSX support  
  - Unidirectional data flow  

---

**2. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?**  
- **JSX** (JavaScript XML) allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.  
- It makes code more readable and easier to create React components.  
- Example:  
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

---

**3. Explain the difference between functional components and class components.**  

| Feature                | Functional Component           | Class Component                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Syntax                 | `function MyComp() {}`       | `class MyComp extends React.Component {}` |
| State                  | `useState` hook              | `this.state`                   |
| Lifecycle methods      | `useEffect` hook             | `componentDidMount`, etc.      |
| Simplicity             | Easier, less boilerplate      | More boilerplate               |

---

**4. What are React props? How are they different from state?**  
- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child components; **read-only**.  
- **State**: Component-specific, **mutable**, triggers re-render when updated.  
```jsx
function Child({ name }) { return <p>{name}</p>; }
```

---

**5. What is the virtual DOM, and how does React use it?**  
- A lightweight **in-memory representation** of the real DOM.  
- React updates the virtual DOM first, calculates the minimal changes, and updates the real DOM efficiently.

---

**6. What is the purpose of `key` in React lists?**  
- Helps React identify which items have changed, added, or removed.  
- Improves rendering performance.  
```jsx
{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
```

---

**7. How does conditional rendering work in React?**  
- You can render elements conditionally using:  
  - Ternary operator: `{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}`  
  - Logical AND: `{isAdmin && <AdminPanel />}`  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Intermediate

**1. What are React hooks? Can you name a few commonly used ones?**  
- Hooks allow functional components to use **state and lifecycle features**.  
- Common hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.

---

**2. Explain `useState` and `useEffect` with examples.**  
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count changed:', count);
  }, [count]);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>;
}
```
- `useState`: declares state in functional components.  
- `useEffect`: handles side effects like API calls, subscriptions, or DOM updates.

---

**3. What is context in React, and when should you use `useContext`?**  
- **Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without props.  
- Use `useContext` to access global state like themes, authentication, or settings.  
```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

---

**4. Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components.**  
- **Controlled**: React controls input state (`value` + `onChange`).  
- **Uncontrolled**: DOM manages input state, use `ref` to access values.  

---

**5. What is React Router, and how does client-side routing work?**  
- React Router is used for **navigating between pages** in SPA without reloading.  
- Works by **matching URL paths** and rendering corresponding components.  

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>
```

---

**6. How do you optimize performance in a React app?**  
- Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
- Use `useMemo` / `useCallback` for expensive computations.  
- Lazy load components with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`.  
- Avoid inline functions in JSX where possible.  

---

**7. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?**  
- Functions that take a component and return a **new enhanced component**.  
```jsx
function withLogger(Component) {
  return function Wrapped(props) {
    console.log('Props:', props);
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced

**1. Explain reconciliation and the diffing algorithm in React.**  
- Reconciliation: React compares virtual DOM with the previous version (diffing) to find **minimal changes** and update efficiently.  

---

**2. What are React Suspense and Concurrent Mode?**  
- **Suspense**: Handles lazy-loading components and asynchronous data.  
- **Concurrent Mode**: Enables interruptible rendering for smoother UIs.  

---

**3. How does `useMemo` and `useCallback` help in optimization?**  
- `useMemo`: Memoizes expensive calculations.  
- `useCallback`: Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  

---

**4. SSR vs CSR vs SSG**  
- **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering): HTML generated on server (e.g., Next.js `getServerSideProps`)  
- **CSR** (Client-Side Rendering): HTML generated in browser (React SPA)  
- **SSG** (Static Site Generation): HTML generated at build time  

---

**5. Explain React Fiber architecture.**  
- Fiber is Reactâ€™s **reimplementation of the reconciliation algorithm** to support incremental rendering and prioritize updates.  

---

**6. How would you implement error boundaries?**  
```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  render() {
    return this.state.hasError ? <h1>Something went wrong.</h1> : this.props.children;
  }
}
```

---

**7. What are React Portals?**  
- Allows rendering children into a **DOM node outside the parent hierarchy**.  
```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById('modal-root'));
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Scenario-Based Questions

**1. React app re-rendering too much â†’ debug/fix:**  
- Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`  
- Check unnecessary state changes  
- Optimize expensive computations  

---

**2. Manage global state in large app:**  
- Options: Redux, Zustand, Context API + useReducer, Recoil  
- Choose based on app complexity and performance needs  

---

**3. Handle authentication & protected routes:**  
- Use context or Redux for auth state  
- Protect routes using `Navigate` in React Router:  
```jsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={user ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />} />
```

---

**4. Render 10,000 items efficiently:**  
- Use **virtualized lists** (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`)  
- Only render items in viewport  

---

**5. Integrate React with backend API:**  
- Use `fetch` or `axios`  
- Use `useEffect` for API calls and set state  
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/data').then(res => res.json()).then(setData);
}, []);
