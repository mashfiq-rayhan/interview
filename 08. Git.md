### ðŸ”¹ Basic

#### 1. What is Git, and how is it different from other VCS (like SVN)?
- **Git**: Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
- **SVN**: Centralized VCS.

| Feature | Git | SVN |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Repository | Local + remote | Central |
| Branching | Lightweight & fast | Heavyweight |
| Offline work | Full repo offline | Limited |
| History | Local copy of history | On server only |

---

#### 2. Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.
- **Git**: Tool for version control.
- **GitHub**: Cloud platform for hosting Git repositories.

---

#### 3. What is a commit in Git?
- A snapshot of project changes at a point in time.
- Command: `git commit -m "message"`

---

#### 4. How do you check the status of your repository?
```bash
git status
```

---

#### 5. What does `git clone` do?
- Clones a remote repository to local.
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

---

#### 6. Difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`
| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `git fetch` | Downloads changes but does not merge |
| `git pull`  | Fetch + merge into current branch |

---

#### 7. Difference between working directory, staging area, and repository
- **Working directory**: Actual files being edited.
- **Staging area**: Changes prepared for commit.
- **Repository**: Stores commits and history.

---

#### 8. What does `git add` do?
- Moves changes to staging area.
```bash
git add <file>
git add .
```

---

#### 9. What is `.gitignore` used for?
- Defines files/folders Git should ignore.

---

#### 10. How do you see commit history in Git?
```bash
git log
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate

#### 1. Difference between `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git checkout`
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git reset` | Move HEAD, can remove commits |
| `git revert` | Creates new commit that undoes changes |
| `git checkout` | Switch branches or restore files |

---

#### 2. What are Git branches and why useful?
- Independent lines of development.
- Useful for features, bug fixes, experiments.

---

#### 3. Difference between merge and rebase
- **Merge**: Combines branches, keeps history.
- **Rebase**: Rewrites commits onto another branch for linear history.

---

#### 4. How do you resolve merge conflicts?
- Edit conflicting files â†’ `git add` â†’ `git commit`

---

#### 5. Fast-forward merge vs 3-way merge
- **Fast-forward**: Just moves branch pointer.
- **3-way merge**: Creates merge commit for diverged branches.

---

#### 6. Undo last commit but keep changes locally
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

---

#### 7. Difference between `git stash` and `git commit`
- **Stash**: Temporary, not in history.
- **Commit**: Permanent in history.

---

#### 8. How do you tag a commit?
```bash
git tag v1.0              # lightweight
git tag -a v1.0 -m "msg"   # annotated
```

---

#### 9. Difference between origin and upstream
- **origin**: Your remote (fork or main repo).
- **upstream**: Original repository you forked from.

---

#### 10. Configure Git username/email
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced

#### 1. Gitâ€™s internal architecture
- **Blob**: Stores file content.
- **Tree**: Directory structure.
- **Commit**: Snapshot reference.
- **Tag**: Named reference.

---

#### 2. Git hooks
- Scripts triggered by events.
- Example: `pre-commit`, `post-commit`.

---

#### 3. Cherry-pick conflicts
- Resolve manually â†’ `git add` â†’ `git cherry-pick --continue`

---

#### 4. Reflog vs log
- `git log`: Shows commits.
- `git reflog`: Shows all HEAD movements.

---

#### 5. `git rebase -i` vs normal rebase
- `-i`: Interactive (squash, reorder, edit).
- Normal: Just reapplies commits.

---

#### 6. Squash multiple commits
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

---

#### 7. Git bisect
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <commit>
```
- Finds commit that introduced a bug.

---

#### 8. Git submodule
- Repo inside another repo.
```bash
git submodule add <url> path
```

---

#### 9. Detached HEAD state
- HEAD points to commit, not a branch.

---

#### 10. Recover a deleted branch
```bash
git reflog
git checkout -b branch <commit_hash>
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Scenario-Based

#### 1. Remove committed password
```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
"git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch file" -- --all
```
(Or use BFG Repo Cleaner)

---

#### 2. Pushed to wrong branch
```bash
git push origin HEAD:<correct-branch>
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

#### 3. Teammate force-pushed
- Communicate â†’ fetch â†’ `git reflog` â†’ recover if needed.

---

#### 4. Move last 3 commits to new branch
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
git cherry-pick main~3..main
git reset --hard main~3
```

---

#### 5. Split commit
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~1
```
Then edit, commit changes separately.

---

#### 6. Prevent pushes to main
- Use branch protection rules (GitHub/Bitbucket).

---

#### 7. Avoid repeated merge commits on pull
```bash
git pull --rebase
```

---

#### 8. Debug bug introduction
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <commit>
```

---

#### 9. Sync local repo behind remote
```bash
git fetch
git rebase origin/main
```

---

#### 10. Migrate large files to LFS
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd"
git add .gitattributes
git add <files>
git commit -m "Move to LFS"
git push origin main
